# Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi
<p>Using the Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi Algorithm to detect collisions</p>
<p>For debugging purposes, the first step is to detect collisions between objects and the camera</p>
<p>These are the ultimate goals by implementing the GJK algorithm and raycasting.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Polygon-Camera collision ✓</li>
    <li>Collsions with raycasting ✓</li>
    <li>Mouse direction/ray collision ✓</li>
    <li>Polygon-Polygon collision</li>
</ul>
